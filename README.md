## 🔐 Features

- **Military-grade Encryption**
  - AES-256 encryption for all stored data
  - PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
  - Secure random IV generation for each encryption

- **Advanced Security**
  - Two-factor authentication (TOTP)
  - Real-time password strength analysis
  - Secure clipboard handling
  - Auto-clear clipboard after copying

- **Modern Interface**
  - 3D animated vault visualization
  - Responsive design for all devices
  - Dark mode optimized
  - Intuitive credential management

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### Encryption Process
1. Master password → PBKDF2 key derivation
2. Unique IV for each credential
3. AES-256-CBC encryption
4. Encrypted data + IV stored separately

### Authentication Flow
1. Master password verification
2. Optional 2FA with TOTP
3. Session management
4. Automatic logout on inactivity

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- All encryption/decryption happens client-side
- Master password never stored or transmitted
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Regular security audits
- Automatic session timeouts
- Secure password generation

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

## 📦 Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
